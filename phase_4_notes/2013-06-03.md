      Innovator's Dilemma

  - tell a story about how the project got to where it's at
  - communicate intention of changes to other team members

  - git aliases

#### git-sh

    $ git-sh
    $ command rm example.txt
    $ git ll
    $ git show
    $ git checkout --orphan my-new-branch
    $ c 098asdf
    $ set
    $ env

What every unix program gets: env, args, stdin

What every unix program outputs: stdout, stderror (stmessage)


He'll email this to us
subl='Appli'
test -x "$subl" && export EDITOR="'$subl' --wait"


remove git index



create orphan branch AND delete index to start from scratch

lockdown ruby version

```s```

```cat .gitignore```

  diff

  diff --cached
    show me the differences between stages and what's in index


show

show HEAD

show master

show master:README.md

show master:README.md > README.md

cat server.sh
a Gemfile.lock
s
unstage .gitignore

(if you want to change the most recent commit)
commit --amend
  n

Quotes: Alan Perlis

diff master
  current branch on top of master
diff HEAD..master
  master on top of current branch

show master:server.rb > server.rb
d server.rb
  same as diff server.rb

add --patch server.rb

  s for split in options

  then say y or n for each chunch on whether to stage it

d server.rb

p server.rb

echo
  take arguemnts and push onto stdout

push origin -u
  -u stands for 'track this branch' so you don't have to say origin... again

If you want to switch the
b -d master
c -b master




## My Notes

### Optimization

[git gc](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gc.html)

options

```
-- aggressive
```


Remove old branches that have been deleted on origin
```
git remote prune origin
```


## Workflow for remaking a git history

1. ```$ git checkout --orphan my-new-branch```
2. remove ```.git/index```
3. remove all files in dir with ```rm *```
4. copy and paste the results of ```$ git checkout --orphan my-new-branch``` into the newly empty dir
5. commit...
6. Pull in files with ```show master:README.md > README.md```, deleting from your new file that which you wish put postpone commiting
7. To move whole directories: ```git checkout master -- db/migrate```


git co master -- db/migrate
HD

undo last commit
```git reset --soft HEAD^ ```

Placing a specific commit somewhere else in the git history
  1. create the commit
  2. ```rebase -i <future_parent_hash>
  3. Copy & paste the order of the commits to match your desired order.
