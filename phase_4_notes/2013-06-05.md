## Code Review

> removing code is better than adding it, reading code is harder than writing it

### Criteria for bringing in dependencies
- Size of source code relative to the problem it's trying to solve

Keynote at Rails conf
  simplicity matters
  simple vs. easy

'acts-as'
  be cautious, you want control of your data model
  affect
  REMOVE

Bug
  delta between development and production
  separate what you can between test and development (Gemfile)

Feature detect, if ENV present
  stagging environment

Avoid polymorphic table

When writing code, ask yourself, "how easy am I making it to delete this code?"

group declarations together based upon end-point functionality, not because they look the same

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  attr_accessible :name
  validates :name, :presence => true

  attr_accessible :email
  validates :email, :presence => true

  attr_accessible :password
  validates :password, :presence => true
  bcrypt_stuff

  def full_name
  end

  def email_something
  end

end
```


## "Don't Reinvent the wheel"

- Need to understand the wheel, look through the source code
    - If that's too exhausting, then it's time to reinvent the wheel.
    - writing a webserver or database is useful
